<h3>Prief</h3>
<p>
As a CY major student, my life revolves around
<em>Security, code, and Testing</em>. But beyond the binary world of
ones and zeros, Iâ€™m also passionate about exploring the great
outdoors. you can find me play football in my neighborhood or soaking
in the sun at the beach. Nature is my escape from the digital realm,
where I can recharge and find inspiration. i also like reading books
my favorite book is blood and fire by goerge rr martin. reading is
like coding in a way. And of course, I can't forget my love for music.
Whether I'm strumming my guitar or getting lost in a symphony, music
has a way of transporting me to another dimension, away from the
complexities of algorithms and data structures. So, while I may spend
most of my time immersed in the world of computers, I cherish these
moments of balance and diversity in my life.
