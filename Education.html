        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          As a CY major student, I embarked on my educational journey with a
          passion for technology and problem-solving. I began my studies at 2022
          and pursued my degree at <strong>Cyber Security</strong>, where I
          dedicated myself to mastering the intricacies of
          <strong>Cyber Security</strong>. Throughout my time there, I immersed
          myself in a variety of courses ranging from programming fundamentals
          to advanced information Encryption and hacking. I delved into subjects
          such as <em>software engineering, database management</em>, honing my
          skills and expanding my knowledge base. Along the way, I also
          participated in workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions, eager
          to put my learning into practice and test my abilities in real-world
          scenarios. As a testament to my dedication and hard work, I earned
          several certificates of achievement in areas such as coding
          proficiency, software development, and project management.
          Additionally, I was honored to receive awards for academic excellence
          and innovation, recognizing my contributions to the field of Cyber
          Security. My education has been a transformative experience, shaping
          me into a proficient and adaptable CY professional ready to tackle the
          challenges of tomorrow's technology landscape.
